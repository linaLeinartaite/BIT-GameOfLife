JAVA basics: GAME OF LIFE

The “Game of Life” was invented by John Horton Conway, a British-born mathematician who is now a professor at Princeton.

The population is a randomly generated collection of grid cells (in a board of dimentions of (x*x)) that are marked as alive ('X'). 
The population evolves at discrete time steps (with total number of cycles (y)).  
At each cycle, the fate of each cell is determined by its eight nearest neighbors (around it) according to following rule: 
if a live cell ('X') has two or three live neighbors ('X') around it, that cell will stay alive at for the next cycle.
